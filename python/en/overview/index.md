# Overview of basic tools

Python is a high level programming language. That means that it contains a lot of
tools that can solve very specific problems. Not all languages have all those tools.

This page gives an overview of all the most universal (basic) tools in python.
Those are the (low-level) programming concepts that, in some form or another, are exist
in almost *any* programming language, not just python.

With combining the concepts below in the right way you can in theory write *any* program.
In fact you even don't need all of them. In theory only a small subset would suffice.

## Operators

- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`: [here](/python/en/basics#operators)
- `=`: [here](/python/en/basics#variables)
- `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`: [here](/python/en/algorithms#more-operators)
- `not`, `and`, `or`: [here](/python/en/algorithms#combining-conditions)

## Datatypes

- `string`: [here](/python/en/basics#printing) and [here](/python/en/basics#types)
- `int`, `float`: [here](/python/en/basics#types)

## input/output:

- `print`: [here](/python/en/basics#printing)
- `input`: [here](/python/en/basics#user-input)

## Algorithmic

- `if`, `elif`, `else`: [here](/python/en/algorithms#conditional-instructions)
- `for`, `while`: [here](/python/en/loops#types-of-loops)

## Functions
- `def`, `return`: [here](python/en/functions)
