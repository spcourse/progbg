# FizzBuzz (level 5)

Make a program called FizzBuzz that asks the user for a number. Count how many numbers between 1 and this number are anti FizzBuzz.
A number is anti FizzBuzz when it's divisible by 3 or 5, but not both. So, 9 is an anti FizzBuzz number, but 15 isn't.

Example:

    Enter a number: 45
    Counting 18 anti FizzBuzz numbers.
