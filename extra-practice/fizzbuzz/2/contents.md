FizzBuzz (level 2)


Make a program called FizzBuzz that asks the user for a number. Loop for all the numbers from 1 to that number and for each number:

- if the number is divisible by 3 print "Fizz"
- if it is divisible by 5 print "Buzz"
- if it is divisible by both 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz"
- otherwise print the number itself

Example:

    Enter a number: 16
    1
    2
