# FizzBuzz (level 7)


Make a program called FizzBuzz that asks the user for a number called `n`. Compute which number is the n'th anti FizzBuzz number.
A number is anti FizzBuzz when it's divisible by 3 or 5, but not both. So 3 is the first anti FizzBuzz number, 5 the second, 6 the third, etc..

Example:

    Enter a number: 7
    The number 18 is the 7th anti FizzBuzz number.
