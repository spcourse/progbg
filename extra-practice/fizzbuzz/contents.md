# FizzBuzz

> This file is intended for the instructor, not for the students.

FizzBuzz is an exercise in decomposition. The students are to try to simplify the
problem until they find a version of the problem they can solve themselves.

So have student **start at level 7**. If they can do it, they are done. If not, talk to the student. See if they can think of a simpler problem (that still contains some elements of FizzBuzz), but that they do know how to solve.

If the student doesn't know. Try to do this for the student. Try to find the highest level the student can solve, and let them work their way up to level 8.

FizzBuzz, level [1](1), [2](2), [3](3)
