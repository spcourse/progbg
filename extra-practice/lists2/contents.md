# Extra practice 2: lists

### 1

Given a list of integers, find a while loop that finds the second largest value in the list

	l = [1, 10, 5, 8, 16, 13]

Example:

	13

### 2

Given a list of integers, find a while loop that creates a new list of all the even numbers in the original list:

	l = [1, 10, 5, 8, 16, 13]

Example:

	[10, 8, 16]

### 3

Given a list of integers, find a for loop that finds the sum of all the numbers in the list that are divisible by 3.

	l = [1, 10, 5, 8, 16, 3]

Example:

    3

### 4

Given a list of strings, find a forloop that creates a new list of all the words in the original list that starts with a capital letter.

	l = [“hello”,  “World”,  “goodbye”, “Moon”, “hi”]

Example:

	[“World”, “Moon”]
