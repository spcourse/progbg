# FizzBuzz (level 6)


Make a program called FizzBuzz that asks the user for a number called `n`. Compute which number is the n-th FizzBuzz number.
A number is FizzBuzz when it's divisible by 3 and 5. So 15 is the first FizzBuzz number, 30 the second, 45 the third, etc..

Example:

    Enter a number: 4
    The number 60 is the 4th FizzBuzz number.
