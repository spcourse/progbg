# Lists


### 1

Given the list `l` here below, find a **for** loop that finds the minimal value.

    l = [1, -10, 5, 8, 16, 3]
    # your code

Example output:

    -10

### 2

Given the list `l` here below, find a **while** loop that finds the minimal value.

    l = [1, -10, 5, 8, 16, 3]
    # your code

Example output:

    -10

### 3

Given the list `l` here below, find a **while** loop that prints all the values of the list until it finds a negative value.

    l = [1, 10, -5, 8, 16, 3]
    # your code

Example output:

    1 10 -5

### 4

Given the list `l` here below, find a **while** loop that creates a new list `l2`. This new list contains all values from `l` up to the first negative value.

    l = [1, 10, -5, 8, 16, 3]
    l2 = []

    # your code

    # print(l2)

Example output:

    [1, 10, -5]

### 4

Given the list `l` here below, find a loop that creates a new list `l2`. This new list contains all values from `l` that are bigger than `5`.

    l = [1, 10, -5, 8, 16, 3]
    l2 = []

    # your code

    # print l2


Example output:

    [10, 8, 16]

### 5

The points in `points` below correspond to the teams in `teams`. The first element of `points` corresponds to the first element of `teams`, etc.
Write a loop that finds the team with the lowest score

    points = [71, 72, 88, 61, 59]
    team = ["AZ", "PSV", "Ajax", "Vitesse", "Feyenoord"]

    # your code

Example output:

    Feyenoord had the lowest score with 59 points.
