# Aspects module 1

As soon as you have submitted working solutions for all problems, your programs will be assessed and graded. The grade will partly depend on how well you integrated specific quality aspects. For this module, your programs will be primarily graded on:

- [comments](/python/en/style#comments)
- [variable naming](/python/en/style#variables)
- [indentation](/python/en/style#indentation)
- [white spaces](/python/en/style#blank-lines-and-extra-spaces)

You can find the grading criteria in the [syllabus](/syllabus#feedback).

Remember to always use `checkpy` to verify your code is working correctly before handing it in.
