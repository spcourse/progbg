# Aspects module 2

As soon as you have submitted working solutions for all problems below, your programs will be assessed and graded. The grade will partly depend on how well you integrated specific quality aspects. This week, your programs will be primarily graded on:

- [Pure function](/python/en/style#pure-functions)
- [Code structure](/python/en/style#structure)

Of course, weâ€™ll also take the aspects from last week into account: [aspects module 1](/aspects/module1)

You can find the grading criteria in the syllabus.

Remember to always use checkpy to verify your code is working correctly before handing it in.
